					<p id="summary">I am a motivated, adaptable individual with a drive to learn, understand, find new solutions, and aid others. I have been programming for over 4 years and have developed the logical capacity and technical knowledge to excel in my trade. I understand the fundamental principles of efficient programming, agile software development, effective OO design, and full user-tailored application life cycles. I am fluent in Spanish and lived in Peru for 15 months, where I learned to direct the flow of conversation to be effective and to listen to the needs of each person, facilitating the aid I could provide.</p>
